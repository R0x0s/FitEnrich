 # Description
 This Eccomerce site is built using JS, Node, React, Redux, MySQL, Strapi, Stripe as well SCSS.
 The site should let you broswe a product selection as well checkout using stripes test payment system as well bring you to a confirmation page of purchase.
 Please send me your email addresses on teams so I can add you as Admins to our CMS Strapi

 ## Installation
 Make sure you have Node V18 installed as well the current patch of MYSQL workbench
 Clone the repo and cd into Api and run npm i or the equivilent in yarn if prefered, CD into client and do the same

 ## Running the Project
 Cd into api and enter "npm run develop", if you have accepted the invite it will bring you to a login page and log in and just have the terminal running in the backround
 After that step now cd into my client in a seperate terminal and enter "npm start" this will bring the store page.

 ## Usage
 Bugs that are in the current commit, when you go to mens or women page you must select one of the radio buttons of low to high or high to low for product ids to show
 Stripe payment system makes a get and post call as seen in the api terminal however when clicking proceed to checkout correctly but does not redirect to payment page
